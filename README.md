## About

My Django Blog Website is a simple web application built using Django, Tailwind CSS, and HTML. It serves as a blog platform where users can read and publish blog posts.

The main features of the blog include user authentication, creating, editing, and deleting blog posts. The front-end design is built with Tailwind CSS, providing a modern and minimalist look and feel. The website uses HTML for the structure and layout of the pages.

This project was created with the intention of learning Django and exploring the possibilities of combining it with Tailwind CSS to create a visually appealing blog website.
