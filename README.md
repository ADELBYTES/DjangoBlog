## About

Django Blog is a web application built using Django, Tailwind CSS, and Vue.js. It serves as a simple and elegant blog platform where users can read and publish blog posts.

The main features of the blog include user authentication, creating, editing, and deleting blog posts, comments, categories, and tags. The front-end design is built with Tailwind CSS, providing a modern and customizable look and feel. Vue.js is used to enhance the user experience and add interactivity to the blog.

This project was inspired by the idea of creating a blog platform that is easy to use, visually appealing, and utilizes the latest web development technologies.
